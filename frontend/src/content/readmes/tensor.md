Multidimensional array operations and device buffers: shapes, dtypes, memory layouts, and elementwise operations across compute devices.

## Quick Start

Run the test suite in `cmd/` directly with `vsc run`:

```bash
vsc run test-tensor
```

## Packages

| Package | Built | Tested |

| `tensor` | `Tensor`: a shape (outermost first, row-major), a `DType` (`F32`, `F16`, `BF16`, and the block formats `Q4_0` and `Q8_0` as ggml lays them out), and bytes on a `gpu.Device`. It is made from host bytes (`FromBytes`, a mapped weight file's tensor) or as `Zeros`, and read as floats in place (`Floats`). Shapes are checked against the format's blocks. `ConcatRows` fuses weights of one input (QKV, gate and up). `Add` adds elementwise | `test-tensor` on the CPU device and Metal |
