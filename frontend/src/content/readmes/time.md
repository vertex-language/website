Time library providing durations, wall and monotonic clocks, and blocking and asynchronous timers.

---

## Packages

- **`time`**: Durations, timestamps, instants and sleeping (`time.Duration`, `time.Timestamp`, `time.Instant`, `time.Sleep`, `time.TimeError`).

---

## Quick Start

Run tools and test suites in `cmd/` directly with `vsc run`:

```bash
# Run all checks
vsc run check

# Time a few sleeps, blocking and asynchronous
vsc run stopwatch
```

```swift
package main

import "time"

func main() async -> int32 {
    let start = time.Instant.Now()
    print("it is \(time.Timestamp.Now())")      // 2026-09-16T23:55:28.127491Z

    do {
        try await time.Sleep(.Milliseconds(250))
        let timeout = try time.Duration.Parse("1m30s")
        print("slept \(start.Elapsed()), timeout \(timeout)")   // slept 260.13375ms, timeout 1m30s
    } catch let e as time.TimeError {
        print(e.Message)
        return 1
    } catch {
        return 1
    }
    return 0
}
```

## Types

| Type | What it is | Clock | Use it for |
|---|---|---|---|
| `Duration` | a signed length of time, to the nanosecond | none | timeouts, intervals, arithmetic |
| `Timestamp` | a moment on the wall clock | `CLOCK_REALTIME` | file times, logs, anything saved or shown |
| `Instant` | a moment on the monotonic clock | the runtime's | measuring, deadlines |

- **`Duration`**: `Nanoseconds`, `Microseconds`, `Milliseconds`, `Seconds`, `Minutes`, `Hours`, `Zero`, `Parse` and `Abs`, plus `+`, `-`, `* int64`, `/ int64` and comparison. Printed in Go's format (`1h2m3.5s`, `1.5ms`, `0s`), which `Parse` reads back.
- **`Timestamp`**: `Now`, `UnixEpoch`, `UnixMilliseconds`, `UTC(year, month, day, ...)`, `UnixSeconds` and `Nanoseconds`, plus `± Duration` and `Timestamp - Timestamp`. Printed as RFC 3339 in UTC.
- **`Instant`**: `Now` and `Elapsed`, plus `± Duration` and `Instant - Instant`. It has no description, because it means nothing outside the process.
- **`Sleep`**: `Sleep(_:)` and `Sleep(until:)`, each in two forms under one name. In an `async` function the async form suspends the task and needs `await`; anywhere else the blocking form blocks the thread.

All three types are `Hashable` and `Comparable`. The wall clock can jump, so there is no `Timestamp - Instant`: the compiler keeps the two clocks apart.

Calendars, time zones and timestamp formatting beyond `description` are not here on purpose.

## Layout

```
time/                 import "time": Duration, Timestamp, Instant, Sleep, TimeError
  clock.cpp           export module time; the wall clock, the monotonic clock, a thread sleep
  clock_posix.cpp     Darwin (clock_gettime, CLOCK_UPTIME_RAW, nanosleep) and Linux (CLOCK_MONOTONIC)
  clock_windows.cpp   GetSystemTimePreciseAsFileTime, QueryPerformanceCounter, Sleep (written, not yet built)
  cmd/check           the test program
  cmd/stopwatch       an example
```

The C++ module's three exports are internal to the package: the `.vs` files call them, and importers see only the Vertex types.

---

## Running

Execute examples or the test suite directly with `vsc`:

```bash
# Run all checks: durations, dates worked out by hand, arithmetic and sleeps
vsc run check

# Time a few sleeps, blocking and asynchronous
vsc run stopwatch
```

`check` is 70 checks and exits with the number that failed. The expected values were verified against the same sources compiled with `swiftc`.
